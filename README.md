## Used 3rd Party Libraries

I use the following 3rd party libraries in my project:

| Name                                                                 | Reason                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [styled components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/styled-components) | I like to use the styled-components library when I work with react because it gives me more control of the styling, better file organization because I don't need to have css/sass or other kinds of styling files. |
| [html-to-image](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-to-image)         | It was easy to implement and use.                                                                                                                                                                                   |

## Installation / Run

The following components must be installed locally:

- [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) v16.10 or higher is recomended.

Not mandatory, but to use yarn CLI:

- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager (similar to npm) developed by facebook.

To run the project locally, enter the following in the command line / bash:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/ptiry02/frontend-junior-code-challenge-3.git
